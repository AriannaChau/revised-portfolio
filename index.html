        <p>My name is Arianna. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I am currently a student at Epicodus in the design track on my way to becoming a front end developer. When I'm not coding, I'm loving on my dogs, playing video games or just spending time outside.</p>
        <p>I had trouble figuring out what I wanted to be, the kind of person I wanted to be in life. I battled different ideas for a long time, and I knew I couldn't just settle for anything. I wanted to do more, I wanted to be more. I wanted to make a difference in others' lives.</p>
        <p>I picked software developing because I thrive off of helping solve people's problems. I like to help, I like to be available when people need me. I felt as if this field was a great way to leave my print on the world as well as connect with others.</p>
